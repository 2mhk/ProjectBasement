# ProjectBasement

Some basic files for self using when starting a new project.

------

I just pick some basic code from my old code to make it easier for starting a new project.

You should test the function by yourself if you wanna use the code.

If you have problems with it,push an issue and i will be glad to answer you.


------


Most of code is for c++11 and Qt,including some useful tools for Jsoncpp.

"//Abandon" means code is not done yet.Interface or structure is not good or something else.

ConnectionGenerator与设计预期不符，建议不要使用
