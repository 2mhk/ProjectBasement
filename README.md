Some basic files for self using when starting a new project.



I just pick some basic code from my old code to make it easier for starting a new project.

You should test the function by yourself if you wanna use the code.

I would like to help you if you have some problems with it.  :->





Most of code is for c++11 and Qt,including some useful tools for Jsoncpp.

"//Abandon" means code is not done yet.Interface or structure is bad or something else.
